# PROJECT6 - "PIIQUANTE" (API) - OpenClassRooms.

This is the REST API I created for one of my OpenClassRooms training projects.
For this project I am using node.js and its framework express.js. Also, I use MongoDB Atlas as database and some dependencies like bcrypt, multer, jsonwebtoken, mongoose..

## Launch server 

To start the server, you only need to install node.js, so you must enter this command in your terminal:

`Node server`
